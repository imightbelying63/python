things that actually do stuff are kept in this directory.  generally speaking, if a script takes some sort of input, 
processes data, and then gives some sort of useful output, it should be here

there's no real organization thus far.

domains.py: look at all domains listed in apache httpd.conf 
   and return if it resolves to the server or not

rearrange.py: cpanel lacks a cli for scripting thru moving accounts, eg home1 -> home2
   this handles that
   
tikparse.py: this just parses and pretty-formats some short notes I was generating about certain customers.
   really i just wanted an excuse to mess around with format spec mini-lang
   
urlshortener.py: simple url shortener
